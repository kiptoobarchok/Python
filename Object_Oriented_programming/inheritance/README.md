# Inheritance

Inheritance allows programmers to create classes that are built upon existing classes, and this enables a class created through inheritance to inherit the attributes and methods of the parent class.

Python not only supports inheritance but multiple inheritance as well.

This allows for code reusability.

Syntax for definition of a class is as follows:
```
class DerivedClassName(BaseClassName):
    pass
```

The name BaseClassName must be defined in a scope containing the derived class definition
