# Tuples

- ordered: 
    in that they are indexed from `first_item[0]`

- Unchangeable:
    we cannot  change, add or remove items after it has been created

- allow duplicates
    since are indexed they can have items with the same value

# number of items
use:     
len() method

        ```
        myTuple = ("a", "b", "c")
        print(len(myTuple))

        output:
        3
        ```

# Tuple constructor
`tuple()` - This is git also possible to use to make a tuple

ie:

    myTuple = tuple(('a', 'b', 'c')) `note the double paranthesis`
    print(myTuple)
    output:
    ('a', 'b', 'c')


# Python Collection (Arrays)

there are 4 collection data types in python :
- [`list`](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp)
    
    ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.

- [Tuple](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_tuples.asp)
    
    ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members

- [set](https://github.com/kiptoobarchok/Python/tree/main/sets)

    unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.

- [Dictionary](https://github.com/kiptoobarchok/Python/tree/main/pythonDictionaries)

    ordered, changeable and do not allow duplicates
